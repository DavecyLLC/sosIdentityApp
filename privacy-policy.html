    <h1>Privacy Policy – SOS Identity</h1>
    <p class="meta">
      <strong>Last Updated:</strong> 2025-12-14<br />
      <strong>Owner:</strong> Davecy LLC
    </p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      SOS Identity (“the App”) is developed and operated by <strong>Davecy LLC</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”).
      This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use the App.
    </p>
    <p>
      SOS Identity is designed as a personal safety tool that stores your identification details, emergency contacts,
      and optional profile information <strong>locally on your device</strong>. The App does not upload, transmit, or
      share your personal data with any server operated by Davecy LLC or third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your data stays on your device only, unless you manually choose to share information (for example, sending an
      SOS message to your emergency contacts).
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>SOS Identity collects and stores only the information you enter into the App. This may include:</p>

    <h3>2.1 Identification Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>ID type</li>
      <li>ID number</li>
      <li>Country</li>
      <li>Optional ID photos (front/back)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of this is stored locally on your device.</p>

    <h3>2.2 User Profile Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Full name</li>
      <li>Blood type</li>
      <li>Medical notes</li>
      <li>Other optional profile details</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Emergency Contact Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Contact name</li>
      <li>Contact phone number</li>
      <li>Primary contact selection</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.4 Device Information (Local Only)</h3>
    <p>
      To enable certain features, the App may access:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your device’s location (GPS) <strong>only when you choose to include location in an SOS message</strong>.</li>
      <li>Your device’s SMS application, so an SOS message can be pre-filled for you to review and send.</li>
      <li>Secure storage on the device, to store an optional PIN used to lock the App.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is not transmitted to Davecy LLC or any external server.
    </p>

    <h3>2.5 No Data Uploaded or Collected Remotely</h3>
    <p>
      We do not operate a backend server for SOS Identity. The App:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does not create user accounts.</li>
      <li>Does not use cloud storage.</li>
      <li>Does not use analytics SDKs.</li>
      <li>Does not sell or transfer your data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How Your Information Is Used</h2>
    <p>Your information is used only for the safety-related features of the App, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Generating an SOS message for your trusted contacts.</li>
      <li>Identifying you and your key medical information in an emergency.</li>
      <li>Sending an SMS (through your default SMS app) to the emergency contact(s) you have chosen.</li>
      <li>Displaying your stored IDs or profile when needed.</li>
      <li>Locking the App using an optional PIN.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, analytics, tracking, or reselling.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <h3>4.1 Local Storage Only</h3>
    <p>
      All personal data is stored locally on your device using technologies such as shared preferences and
      platform-secure storage. No personal data is uploaded to Davecy LLC servers.
    </p>

    <h3>4.2 PIN Protection</h3>
    <p>
      You may enable an optional PIN lock to restrict access to your data within the App. When supported by the device,
      PINs are stored in secure storage provided by the operating system.
    </p>

    <h3>4.3 We Do Not Store or Control Your Data</h3>
    <p>
      Davecy LLC never receives your stored IDs, contacts, or profile data. We cannot view, restore, or recover it.
      If you uninstall the App or reset your device, your data is permanently removed from that device.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Location Information</h2>
    <p>
      The App may request permission to access your device’s location <strong>only if you choose to include GPS
      information in your SOS message</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Location is used one time to create a link (for example, a Google Maps URL) to include in your message.</li>
      <li>Location data is not stored on our servers (we do not have servers for this App) or tracked over time.</li>
      <li>You may disable location access at any time in your device settings or within the App's options.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>
      SOS Identity does not automatically share your information with anyone. Information is only shared when you
      choose to do so, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sending an SOS SMS to your emergency contact(s).</li>
      <li>Showing your IDs or profile to helpers, responders, or medical personnel.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You remain in control of what is shared and when.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      SOS Identity is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information
      from children. If you believe a child has provided information via the App, please contact us so we can help
      guide any necessary steps on the device.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <p>You have full control over your data within the App:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You may add, edit, or delete IDs, contacts, and profile information.</li>
      <li>You may enable or disable location access.</li>
      <li>You may enable or disable the PIN lock.</li>
      <li>You may delete all App data by uninstalling the App from your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Because we do not store your data on our servers, we cannot access, export, or restore it on your behalf.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App relies on a few services that are built into your device:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your device’s SMS application, which actually sends the message you choose to send.</li>
      <li>Your device’s location services, if you grant permission for GPS usage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not integrate third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or remote databases in this version of the App.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated
      “Last Updated” date. Your continued use of the App after changes are posted will signify your acceptance of
      those changes.
    </p>
